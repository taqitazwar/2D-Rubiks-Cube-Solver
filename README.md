## Description
A Java-based **Rubikâ€™s Cube Solver** with a graphical interface. It supports:

- **Brute Force (IDDFS)** â€“ Uses depth-first search to explore move sequences and solve the cube.
- **Optimal Solver (IDA*)** â€“ Uses a heuristic-based search to find the shortest solution efficiently.

## Installation
1. Ensure **Java** (JDK) is installed.
2. Download or clone the repository.
3. Compile the project:
   ```sh
   javac *.java
   ```
4. Run the program:

   java RubiksCubeGUI
   ```

## Usage
- **Apply Moves**: Select a move from the dropdown and click `Apply Move`.
- **Scramble the Cube**: Apply multiple moves manually.
- **Solve the Cube**: Choose a solving method and click `Solve Cube`.
- **View Solution**: The solution sequence appears in the output area.
- **Animate Solution**: Click `Animate Solution` to watch the solving process step-by-step.
- **Reset Cube**: Click `Reset Cube` to return to a solved state.
