# 2D Rubik's Cube Solver

## Description
A Java-based **Rubik’s Cube Solver** with a graphical interface. It supports:

- **Brute Force (IDDFS)** – Uses depth-first search to explore move sequences and solve the cube.
- **Optimal Solver (IDA*)** – Uses a heuristic-based search to find the shortest solution efficiently.

## Installation
